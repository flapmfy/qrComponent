## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use css variables.

### Continued development

I would like to get more confident and thus a lot faster during a build of a project. The area of my technical documentation is lacking in many aspects too so that is another point where I can drastically improve. I also tend to use same technologies such as flexbox over and over again so it would be great to learn something like grid.
